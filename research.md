-  [Collateral Damage: The Impact of Forced Eradication of Illicit Crops on Human Capital](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4694457). With Daniela Horta Sáenz. Working paper. Feb 2024.

Abstract: The role of eradication policies in decreasing drug trade, insecurity, and ultimately fostering development remains largely debated. This paper examines the unintended consequences of aerial fumigation of coca on human capital accumulation and its medium-term socioeconomic impacts in Colombia. Employing a spatial regression discontinuity design and utilizing newly digitized data on the exact location subject of aerial spraying, we find that eradication increases school dropout and failure rates in the short term.
